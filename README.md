=========

my config files for terminal on Mac + linux systems, including vim

Installing
----------

    % cd ~
    % git init
    % git remote add origin <this repo url>
    % git pull origin master     

*note there will probably be conflicts that prevent this working immediately. delete or manually merge conflicting files.*
  
restart terminal
